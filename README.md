- Fixed recents and favorites in the File menu; added right-click option to remove only one item from the list
- Various fixes to the Background/Inpainter tool, finally starts to work like it is supposed to (easy way to use is to use one of my presets for background removal or inpaint to start, next you can change prompt etc

  day
- **Better integration with queue for the TXT2IMG models:** 
  At the moment it is not using the queue until i have more time for this
- zip with over **100 intros**
- Global action buttons (a button action changes depending on the tab you are
- Multi job where user can select more then one tool and do them all at once (for example upscale->rife->add sound...)
- polishing and bugfixing for the rest of my life i think
- a low weight txt/img to video would be nice but let's get the rest working 100% first
  (many failed attempts so far)
- **Easter eggs** for extra fun surprises! Don't forget to click the intro 4x before it ends ;-)

## üîÑ How to Update FrameVision

Keeping FrameVision up to date is **super easy** ‚Äî 
Inside the app go to the file menu that says 'info', in there you find update with 4 option :
Stable : updates to the latest release, option for full update or puthon files only
Beta : updates to the most recent files on the github page, these files can change every day and bring test features but also bugs and unfinished work. Also has option for full update or python file only
---


### üü¢ `update_all.bat`
**Safe & Non-Destructive**  
If you can't get in the app anymore there is also an update_all.bat file, delete folder \helpers\ and if needed also the .venv directory before running this.
**Best for:**  
- app don't start and option 2 from installer (quick fixer) didn't work either, this sets you back to official release.

---

### üî¥ Hard Update ‚Äî `RESET_ALL.bat`
**Strict Sync (Advanced)**  
- ‚úÖ Adds **new files**  
- ‚úÖ Updates **changed files**  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Restores deleted files**  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Removes all local files** 
**Best for:**  
- Resetting to a **clean, exact copy** of the latest GitHub version.
