# FrameVision — CUDA (GPU) requirements for SDXL + Describer (Vision) — clean, compatible pins
# Torch/TorchVision/Torchaudio are installed separately with CUDA wheels. Do NOT add them here.

# NOTE:
# - transformers 4.56.x pairs with tokenizers 0.22–0.23.x
# - pillow 11.x can be fine, but 10.4.0 is broadly compatible with py3.10/3.11 + many wheels
# - adjust pins here (not inline in the .bat) to avoid batch escaping issues
