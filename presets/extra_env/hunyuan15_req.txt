# HunyuanVideo-1.5 (Diffusers) runtime deps
# Keep this file reasonably "broad" (avoid hard pins) to reduce install failures on Windows.

# NOTE: FlashAttention is intentionally NOT listed here.
# On Windows it often tries to build from source (slow / fragile). FrameVision installs a known-good
# prebuilt wheel from the HunyuanVideo installer when the environment matches (Python 3.11 + torch 2.5.1 + cu124).
