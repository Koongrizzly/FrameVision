  "prompt": "A dog, adorned in a vibrant red collar, energetically chases after its small, round white ball as it frolics across the expansive prairie under a clear blue sky, illuminated by soft, diffused sunlight filtering through the sparse clouds overhead. The scene is captured from a low angle, emphasizing the dog's playful energy and the vastness of the prairie.
